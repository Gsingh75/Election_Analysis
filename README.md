# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
We were given the task of completing the election audit of a recent local congressional election in the state of Colorado, which included the following tasks:

1. To compute the total number of votes cast in the election.
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. To find out the percentage of votes each candidate won.
4. To calculate the total number of votes each candidate won.
5. To figure out who was the winner of the election based on the popular vote? 

## Resources
-Data Source: election_results.csv
-Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.70.2

## Summary
The analysis of the election results produced the following:\n
Total Votes: 369,711

Votes for each candidate (in % and in numbers):
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

The winner of the election:
Winner: Diana DeGette
Winning vote Count: 272,892
Winning Percentage: 73.8%

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, We made use of a very popular and useful tool/programming language- Python, to do an analysis of 
a data file provided to us in the .csv format. We used the popular text editor Visual Code to write the python program
and then read the .csv file provided and at the same time write our results to a .txt file. This .csv file included data 
from an election, esentially the results of it and we had the task of analyzing it thoroughly row by row and column by column 
to compute and summarize the election results and in the end, declare our winner!

## Challenge Summary 
In this challenge, we were assisting a Colorado board of elections employee, Tom, in an election audit of the tabulated results 
for a U.S. congressional precinct in Colorado. We were tasked with reporting the total number of votes cast, the total number of 
votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote. 
This task is usually done in Excel, but Tom's manager wanted to know if there's a way to automate the process using Python. 
If this audit is done successfully with Python, the code me and Tom write will be used to audit not only other congressional 
districts, but also senatorial districts and local elections. There are three primary voting methods that me and Tom will take into account, 
mail-in ballots, punch cards, and direct recording electronic, or DRE, counting machines. Mail-in ballots are typically hand counted at the 
central office. Punch cards are collected and then fed into a machine that tabulates vote totals and sends the results to the central office. 
Finally, memory cards from DRE counting machines are sent to the central office and read by a computer. Altogether, the votes cast by these 
three methods will determine the final election results. After the votes are counted, our job was to generate a vote count report to certify 
this U.S. congressional race.
